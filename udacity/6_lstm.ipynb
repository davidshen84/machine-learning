    "We want to train a LSTM over bigrams, that is pairs of consecutive characters like 'ab' instead of single characters like 'a'. Since the number of possible bigrams is large, feeding them directly to the LSTM using 1-hot encodings will lead to a very sparse representation that is very wasteful computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "a- Introduce an embedding lookup on the inputs, and feed the embeddings to the LSTM cell instead of the inputs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "b- Write a bigram-based LSTM, modeled on the character LSTM above.\n",
    "\n",
    "c- Introduce Dropout. For best practices on how to use Dropout in LSTMs, refer to this [article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329).\n",
